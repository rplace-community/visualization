# Social interactions on the /r/place

The aim of this project is to show online interactions between Reddit communities, called subreddits, during the /r/place event in 2017. The datasets used for this project were :

* Kaggle for the Reddit r/Place History dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/reddit-rplace-history

* RolandR github repository, with its atlas of final communities: https://github.com/RolandR/place-atlas

In this repository you will be able to find the visualization : https://github.com/rplace-community/visualization
You will be able to find the preprocessing repository here : https://github.com/rplace-community/preprocessing
And here, you will find the old repository (before we moved everything to this one) : https://github.com/mj2905/DataVis
