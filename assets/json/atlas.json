At one point, some Overwatch faction members attempted to create the phrase \"HANZO SWITCH PLS\", basing it around the \"SWITCH\" from the neighboring Nintendo Switch sprite. This occured roughly at the same time that the Oneshot faction began to create Niko, and eventually the \"PLS\" and the Niko sprite began to overlap. The Oneshot faction attempted to move the S below the Niko sprite, and a bit of dialogue between various members of both factions proved fruitful at first, until some more agressive members began to put the S over Niko anyway. This started a war of attrition between the two factions, resulting in a compromise of the S being highlighted over the highlighted Niko sprite. Sadly, the pun was not to last, as the Swedish flag would soon invade and conquer much of the north eastern corner, taking the Hanzo and Pls along with it, yet allowing Niko to remain.",

Realizing that he was outnumbered by people unaware of the plan, organization for it was moved into the Dwarf Fortress discord server, and those working against it (or attempting to work for it but not in concert with the plan) were recruited to the discord via reddit PMs. As /r/place activity on the DF discord grew rapidly, a new text channel was created for it.  Soon after it was completed according to the original plan despite the counter-efforts of a redditor very upset about the destruction of a dwarf they had been working on. Later, the 3 tile wide slash was compacted to 2 tiles during an effort to reorganize and compact the lower row of dwarves to gain more room for art. ",

Information suggested the void would not target the UK directly due to its strength, instead destroying the area below and moving west into Italy.<br>An agreement between the two countries was reached. The UK would expand its considerable botnet to cover the entirety of the Italian flag. In return, Italy would help to build Big Ben in the space the void left after destroying Mexico.<br>The void attacked once more. Many smaller projects were destroyed to the south, outside of the UK's area of protection. However, UK and Italy stood strong, barely able to harm either country. After the attack, the bond between the two nations stood. As a further act of their friendship, the two planned to cover the hole of the void with a depiction of Dante and Shakespeare to the south.",

Every now and then some random griefers would come by, but we managed to fight them off every time. We got a little too close to Scott Pilgrim so with team Scott's help we moved our text slightly to the left. Then came Spelunky, they wanted to build a border around their pixel art and asked us to move one pixel up, so we did, again with their cooperation. Then came Lehigh university from the left. This guy just wanted the text \"Lehigh\" there to represent his university, again we came to a compromise together. <br>But then, after 3 days of cooperation with strangers and battling griefers, about 20 minutes before /r/place was going to end, came the Lehigh university marching band, \"Lehigh 97\". They did not want the text to simply represent their university, it had to represent their marching band. So they trampled their \"97\" over our \"ca\". We were outnumbered. Even the original creator of \"Lehigh\" tried to help stopping them destroying our very small project. We were proud of being able to keep our pixels alive in the giant internet WW3 for 3 days long. After actually meeting some decent people on the internet we were reminded of the usual internet trolls, the jerks of Lehigh University's marching band.

It was one of the many early color nations like blue, purple, red, and green.  Unlike the other color nations, pink attracted \"The Followers of Pink\", a loose philosophy built not on war or overwriting, but on simply spreading the warm embrace of pink throughout the canvas.  In this way The Followers of Pink were similar to The Void or Erase This Place, but without an interest in overwriting. Their interest was in peace and simply filling the monochrome (the blank canvas) with the warm peaceful embrace of pink.  \nA few gathered under r/PinkUnion, but were never highly organized.  The region saw fierce battles early on.  First in the south eastern corner where The Blue Corners impending wave hammered away at The Pink Province.  Next at the south western corner where a rainbow (possibly associated with r/ainbowroad) ultimately succeeded in passing through.  The Followers of Pink and r/PinkUnion fought valiantly to preserve the Pink Province and Sovereign Triangle, but the final blow came when the osu! began construction of their second larger logo. Construction began without consent, and ultimately the moderators of r/PinkUnion agreed to a treaty.  Several of The Followers of Pink saw this as an affront to an established pink space, the Sovereign Triangle, which in a rapidly filling canvas became symbolic.  So while osu! constructed their much larger logo with a near mechanical efficiency, The Followers of Pink and supporters fought back by filling the letters and areas that were once The Sovereign Triangle with pink pixels (and other colors).  Due to the pink background of the osu! logo, numerous onslaughts, the disparate nature of The Followers of Pink, and the small size of r/PinkUnion, The Sovereign Triangle was ultimately lost to history.  Though, the battles for, and evidence of, The Sovereign Triangle and Pink Province remain ever evident in the data. ",
