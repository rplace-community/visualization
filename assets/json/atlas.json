The Dog's makers diligently defended it against encroaching pixels from the red corner and random vandals and were soon joined by many others (who did not know its origin and just thought it a cute-looking dog). Thus, /r/Goodboye was born to defend /r/place's very own doggo. The Goodboyes decided to expand with another mirror-image dog to their left, but received friction from /r/TheNetherlands, who were attempting to expand into the same space. Eventually, the two reached a truce, with the left Boye wearing clogs as a compromise. As a result, the Boyes were placed under protection from /r/TheNetherlands and became allies.",

  "description": "The center of the canvas was a controversial and disputed part of r/place. It began to be filled with numerous randomly placed pixels. As organized groups began creating masterpieces, the center began a white void, part of r/erase. As the original (dark) Void began to eat the center of the canvas, the USA Flag began to take shape covering a branch from the void. The flag took over the white void and a few projects including a smiley and a tree. Then the void reappeared in place and with other people erased most of the flag as RainbowRoad expanded where the flag was. Ireland saw an opportunity  and decided to expand as well. A net of yellow lines appeared and took over the void and r/AmericanFlaginPlace with help of r/TheDonald and other redditors, helped fight for their territory and reconstruct the USA Flag. \"E Pluribus Unum\" on the side",

  "description": "The Sovereign Triangle, also known as \"the Pink Province\", was a heavily disputed area in the south of the canvas.  It was one of the many early color nations like blue, purple, red, and green.  Unlike the other color nations, pink attracted \"The Followers of Pink\", a loose philosophy built not on war or overwriting, but on simply spreading the warm embrace of pink throughout the canvas.  In this way The Followers of Pink were similar to The Void or Erase This Place, but without an interest in overwriting. Their interest was in peace and simply filling the monochrome (the blank canvas) with the warm peaceful embrace of pink.  \nA few gathered under r/PinkUnion, but were never highly organized.  The region saw fierce battles early on.  First in the south eastern corner where The Blue Corners impending wave hammered away at The Pink Province.  Next at the south western corner where a rainbow (possibly associated with r/ainbowroad) ultimately succeeded in passing through.  The Followers of Pink and r/PinkUnion fought valiantly to preserve the Pink Province and Sovereign Triangle, but the final blow came when the osu! began construction of their second larger logo. Construction began without consent, and ultimately the moderators of r/PinkUnion agreed to a treaty.  Several of The Followers of Pink saw this as an affront to an established pink space, the Sovereign Triangle, which in a rapidly filling canvas became symbolic.  So while osu! constructed their much larger logo with a near mechanical efficiency, The Followers of Pink and supporters fought back by filling the letters and areas that were once The Sovereign Triangle with pink pixels (and other colors).  Due to the pink background of the osu! logo, numerous onslaughts, the disparate nature of The Followers of Pink, and the small size of r/PinkUnion, The Sovereign Triangle was ultimately lost to history.  Though, the battles for, and evidence of, The Sovereign Triangle and Pink Province remain ever evident in the data. ",
