Unlike the other color nations, pink attracted \"The Followers of Pink\", a loose philosophy built not on war or overwriting, but on simply spreading the warm embrace of pink throughout the canvas.  In this way The Followers of Pink were similar to The Void or Erase This Place, but without an interest in overwriting. Their interest was in peace and simply filling the monochrome (the blank canvas) with the warm peaceful embrace of pink.  \nA few gathered under r/PinkUnion, but were never highly organized.  The region saw fierce battles early on.  First in the south eastern corner where The Blue Corners impending wave hammered away at The Pink Province.  Next at the south western corner where a rainbow (possibly associated with r/ainbowroad) ultimately succeeded in passing through.  The Followers of Pink and r/PinkUnion fought valiantly to preserve the Pink Province and Sovereign Triangle, but the final blow came when the osu! began construction of their second larger logo. Construction began without consent, and ultimately the moderators of r/PinkUnion agreed to a treaty.  Several of The Followers of Pink saw this as an affront to an established pink space, the Sovereign Triangle, which in a rapidly filling canvas became symbolic.  So while osu! constructed their much larger logo with a near mechanical efficiency, The Followers of Pink and supporters fought back by filling the letters and areas that were once The Sovereign Triangle with pink pixels (and other colors).  Due to the pink background of the osu! logo, numerous onslaughts, the disparate nature of The Followers of Pink, and the small size of r/PinkUnion, The Sovereign Triangle was ultimately lost to history.
